{"id": "7d29a3c3", "timestamp": "2025-11-29 17:01", "app_idea": "AI food tracker", "budget": "$20", "skill": "No Code", "plan": "Okay, building an AI food tracker with no code and a small budget? Sounds like a fun challenge! Let's get you to an MVP as fast as possible.\n\n## The Stack\n\n1.  **Image Recognition: Clarifai** - Instead of building your own AI, use a pre-trained model. Clarifai is known for image recognition, and you can access it without writing code through integrations.\n2.  **Backend & Database: Supabase** - Think of Supabase as an open-source Firebase alternative. It gives you a database to store user info and food logs, authentication to manage users, and lets you create \"serverless functions\" (small bits of code that run in the cloud) to connect everything together. It has a generous free tier.\n3.  **No-Code App Builder: Bubble** - Bubble lets you build web and mobile apps with a drag-and-drop interface. It connects to external services (like Clarifai and Supabase) using APIs. This is where you'll design the look and feel of your app.\n\n## The Logic\n\n*   **Why Clarifai?** You said \"fairly good\" image recognition is needed. Clarifai's pre-trained models will get you there faster than trying to build your own. Plus, it integrates with no-code platforms.\n*   **Why Supabase?** You need a place to store data (food logs, user info). Supabase gives you a database, user management, and the ability to run small bits of code \u2013 all essential for connecting Clarifai to your app and handling user data. The free tier lets you validate your idea without spending money.\n*   **Why Bubble?** Bubble is powerful and flexible. You can design your app visually, connect to APIs (like Clarifai and Supabase), and handle user interactions without writing code. It's perfect for a no-code MVP.\n\n## The Blueprint\n\nHere\u2019s your immediate to-do list:\n\n1.  **Create Accounts:** Sign up for free accounts on Clarifai, Supabase, and Bubble.\n2.  **Supabase Setup:** Create a new Supabase project. Design a simple database table to store food logs. Include columns for `user_id`, `timestamp`, `food_name`, `quantity`, and `notes` (for those \"no sugar\" details).\n3.  **Bubble App Creation:** Start a new Bubble app. Design the basic UI: a page for taking/uploading food pictures, a page to enter quantities/notes, and a page to view the food log.\n4.  **Clarifai Integration:** Use Bubble's API Connector to connect to the Clarifai API. You'll need your Clarifai API key. Configure the API call to send images to Clarifai and receive food predictions.\n5.  **Data Flow:** Connect the pieces. When a user uploads a picture, send it to Clarifai. Display the food predictions in your Bubble app. Let the user confirm the food, enter the quantity/notes, and save the data to your Supabase database.\n6.  **User Authentication:** Set up user sign-up and login in Bubble using Supabase's authentication. This will allow users to save food logs.\n\n## Pro Tip\n\nTo kickstart your Clarifai integration, use this prompt in Bubble's API Connector:\n\n```\nAPI Name: Clarifai\nAuthentication: Private Key in Header\nHeader Key: Authorization\nHeader Value: Key YOUR_CLARIFAI_API_KEY (replace with your actual API key)\n\nAPI Call:\n  Name: Predict Food\n  Method: POST\n  URL: https://api.clarifai.com/v2/models/food-recognition/versions/1bb4189b25444c1bb5c58803e79af504/outputs\n  Payload Type: JSON\n  Body:\n  {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"data\": {\n          \"image\": {\n            \"base64\": \"<<base64_encoded_image>>\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n\n*Explanation:* This sets up the basic API call to Clarifai's food recognition model. You'll need to replace `YOUR_CLARIFAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key from Clarifai. The `<<base64_encoded_image>>` will be replaced with the actual image data from Bubble.\n"}
