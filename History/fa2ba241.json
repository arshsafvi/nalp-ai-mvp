{"id": "fa2ba241", "timestamp": "Nov 29", "app_idea": "I want to build an AI mood tracker.", "budget": "N/A", "skill": "N/A", "plan": "Okay, let's build an AI Mood Tracker for iOS and Android with a no-code approach, a $50 budget, and a balanced priority (meaning decent performance and maintainability).\n\n### 1. The Stack:\n    *   **Backend & Database:** Google Sheets + Google Apps Script.\n    *   **AI Mood Analysis:** Hugging Face Inference API.\n    *   **Frontend (Mobile Apps):** Glide.\n\n### 2. The Logic:\n    *   **Google Sheets + Google Apps Script:**\n        *   *ELI5:* It's a free, simple database and server in one. Google Sheets stores your mood data, and Apps Script lets you run code to process it.\n        *   *WHY:* No-code, free (within reasonable usage), and easy to set up. Perfect for handling small-scale data storage and processing.\n    *   **Hugging Face Inference API:**\n        *   *ELI5:* It's a tool that lets you use AI models without needing powerful computers. We'll use it to analyze text and determine mood.\n        *   *WHY:* Offers pre-trained sentiment analysis models accessible via API calls. The free tier should be sufficient for initial development. Pay-as-you-go after that.\n    *   **Glide:**\n        *   *ELI5:* It turns Google Sheets into mobile apps.\n        *   *WHY:* True no-code platform. Glide directly connects to Google Sheets, making data display and user input easy to manage.\n\n### 3. The Blueprint:\n    1.  **Set up Google Sheet:**\n        *   Create a new Google Sheet with columns for: \"Timestamp,\" \"Mood Input (Text),\" \"Mood Score,\" \"Mood Label.\"\n    2.  **Create Hugging Face Account & Get API Key:**\n        *   Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and obtain an API key.\n    3.  **Write Google Apps Script:**\n        *   Open the Script editor in your Google Sheet (Tools > Script editor).\n        *   Write a function that:\n            *   Takes the \"Mood Input (Text)\" from the sheet.\n            *   Sends it to the Hugging Face Inference API for sentiment analysis.  (See Pro Tip for the prompt)\n            *   Receives the sentiment score and label.\n            *   Writes the \"Mood Score\" and \"Mood Label\" back to the Google Sheet.\n        *   Create a trigger to run this function automatically whenever a new row is added to the sheet.\n    4.  **Build Glide App:**\n        *   Create a new app in Glide and connect it to your Google Sheet.\n        *   Design the app interface:\n            *   A screen for users to input their mood (text field).\n            *   A screen to display mood history (using the data from the Google Sheet).\n    5.  **Test & Iterate:**\n        *   Test the app thoroughly on both iOS and Android (via Glide's preview feature).\n        *   Refine the Apps Script and Glide app based on testing.\n\n### 4. Pro Tip:\n    *   **Hugging Face API Prompt:** When calling the Hugging Face Inference API, use the `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model for sentiment analysis. The prompt should be the user's mood input text. Example python code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport os\n\nAPI_TOKEN = os.environ[\"HF_API_TOKEN\"] # set in environment variables\n\nAPI_URL = \"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"\nheaders = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {API_TOKEN}\"}\n\ndef query(payload):\n    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)\n    return response.json()\ntext = \"I am feeling great today\"\ndata = query({\"inputs\": text})\nprint(data)\n# Example Output:\n# [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998774528503418}]\n```\n\nWrite a Google Apps Script that replicates this functionality using the `UrlFetchApp.fetch()` method.\n"}
