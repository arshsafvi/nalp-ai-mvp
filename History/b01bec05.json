Prioritize a clean and intuitive user experience.\", \"2. **Firebase Setup:** Configure Firebase Authentication for user sign-up/login. Set up a Firebase database to store user profiles, gym locations, fitness goals, and match preferences.\", \"3. **FlutterFlow Integration with Firebase:** Connect FlutterFlow to Firebase to read and write data. Implement user authentication and profile creation.\", \"4. **Location Awareness:** Use FlutterFlow's location services or a plugin to determine user's gym location.  Restrict matching to users within the same gym.\", \"5. **Matching Algorithm:** Develop a matching algorithm that considers fitness goals, preferred workout times, and other relevant criteria. Implement this logic in FlutterFlow using custom functions or Firebase Cloud Functions.\", \"6. **Chat Functionality:** Integrate a simple chat feature using Firebase Cloud Firestore for real-time messaging between matched users.\", \"7. **Testing and Iteration:** Conduct thorough testing with gym-goers to identify bugs, usability issues, and areas for improvement.
