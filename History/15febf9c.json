{"id": "15febf9c", "timestamp": "Nov 30", "app_idea": "I want to build an AI real estate porfolio tracker\n", "budget": "N/A", "skill": "N/A", "plan": "{\"pro_tip\": \"Focus on a niche within real estate (e.g., residential rentals) to reduce complexity and ensure the AI can provide accurate insights within your budget.\", \"stack_reasoning\": \"Given your pro skills and limited budget, a Python-based solution with cloud-based services is most viable. Python handles data analysis and AI integration well, and cloud services offer scalability and cost-effectiveness. Open-source tools minimize expenses. However, creating a truly *intelligent* and reliable portfolio tracker for $700 is extremely challenging. Failure is a real possibility if data acquisition and AI model training are more complex than anticipated.\", \"tools_list\": [\"Python\", \"Pandas\", \"Scikit-learn\", \"Flask/FastAPI\", \"PostgreSQL\", \"AWS/GCP/Azure (Free Tier)\", \"Beautiful Soup/Scrapy\"], \"build_steps\": [\"1. Data Acquisition: Scrape real estate data from publicly available sources (e.g., Zillow, Realtor.com) using Beautiful Soup or Scrapy. Be mindful of terms of service. Or, use existing APIs, but those might have a cost.\", \"2. Data Storage: Set up a PostgreSQL database (or similar) on a cloud provider's free tier (AWS, GCP, Azure). Structure the database to store property information, transaction history, and other relevant data.\", \"3. Data Cleaning & Preparation: Use Pandas to clean and preprocess the scraped data. Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data type conversions.\", \"4. AI Model Development: Use Scikit-learn to build a simple predictive model for property valuation or investment potential. Given your budget, focus on a model with explainable AI (XAI) features.\", \"5. API Development: Create a REST API using Flask or FastAPI to expose the AI model and data to a front-end interface.\", \"6. Front-End Development: Build a basic front-end interface (using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to allow users to input portfolio details and view AI-driven insights.\", \"7. Deployment: Deploy the API and front-end to a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, Netlify).\", \"8. Testing and Refinement: Thoroughly test the application and refine the AI model based on user feedback and real-world performance. This is crucial and likely to require more work than initially planned.\"], \"copy_paste_prompt\": \"Write a Python function using Pandas to clean real estate data, handling missing values in 'price', 'square_footage', and 'location' columns. For 'price', impute missing values with the median. For 'square_footage', impute with the mean. For 'location', fill missing values with 'Unknown'. The function should take a Pandas DataFrame as input and return a cleaned DataFrame.  Ensure the location column is string type.\", \"detected_tools\": []}"}
