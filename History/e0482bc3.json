Prioritize the matching algorithm and user experience.\", \"stack_reasoning\": \"Given the budget and skill level, a low-code/no-code platform is the most viable option. FlutterFlow allows for iOS app development with a drag-and-drop interface. Firebase provides backend services like authentication, database, and storage, and integrates well with FlutterFlow. For the chat feature, Firebase's Realtime Database offers a simple solution. Supabase is a good alternative to Firebase if you need more control and flexibility. The plan starts with flutterflow to quickly build the UI, then firebase to manage users and chat.\", \"tools_list\": [\"FlutterFlow\", \"Firebase\", \"Supabase\"], \"budget_breakdown\": [{\"item\": \"FlutterFlow Subscription (Basic Plan)\", \"cost\": \"$30\"}, {\"item\": \"Firebase Usage (Pay-as-you-go - estimate for initial usage)\", \"cost\": \"$30\"}, {\"item\": \"Supabase Usage (Free Tier - scaling costs might arise later)\", \"cost\": \"$0\"}], \"build_steps\": [\"1. **Set up FlutterFlow Project:** Create a new project in FlutterFlow and choose a suitable template or start from scratch.\", \"2. **Design User Profile UI:** Design the user profile screens with fields for fitness goals, interests, schedule, and profile picture.

Configure email/password and potentially social login.\", \"4. **Build Matching Algorithm:** Develop a simple matching algorithm based on fitness goals, interests, and schedule. Implement this logic within FlutterFlow using custom functions or actions. Store user data and preferences in Firebase Firestore or Supabase Postgres.\", \"5. **Create Swipe Interface:** Design the Tinder-style swipe interface for users to view potential workout partners. Implement swipe gestures and actions to like or dislike profiles.\", \"6. **Implement Chat Feature:** Integrate Firebase Realtime Database or Supabase Realtime for the chat feature. Allow users to send and receive messages within the app.\", \"7. **Test and Iterate:** Thoroughly test the app on iOS devices and iterate based on user feedback.
