True native mobile apps for iOS and Android with high quality are not feasible for $300.\", \"stack_reasoning\": \"Your $300 budget is severely limiting for a 'quality' Tinder-like app across both iOS and Android, especially with real-time chat and media uploads for a beginner. Based on the live search results, Bubble is the best no-code platform for building Tinder-style logic without coding, handling profiles, media uploads, and basic real-time interactions. However, Bubble primarily builds responsive web applications. Getting a true native experience on iOS and Android will require significant additional work and cost beyond your budget, making a high-quality dual-platform app impossible. This plan focuses on a powerful web-based MVP accessible on mobile browsers.\", \"tools_list\": [\"Bubble\"], \"budget_breakdown\": [{\"item\": \"Bubble (Growth Plan)\", \"cost\": \"$119/mo\"}, {\"item\": \"Total Estimated Cost\", \"cost\": \"$119/mo\"}], \"build_steps\": [\"Step 1: Go to Bubble.io and sign up for an account.
